Problem Description
Use sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train your model using logistic regression. You need to figure out the accuracy of your model and use that to predict different samples in your test dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal length
Petal width
Using above 4 features you will classify a flower  in one of the three categories,
